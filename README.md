## üíª Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The game follows an object-oriented approach with these key classes:

#### Core Game Classes
- **Player**: Manages player attributes, movement, and rendering
- **GamePanel**: Main game interface handling rendering and user interactions
- **GameObject**: Base class for game elements with position and graphical representation
- **Events**: Handles the various in-game events (start, fate, exchange, task)
- **Dice**: Implements dice rolling mechanics with animation

#### UI and Threading
- **PaintThread**: Manages continuous screen updates
- **IconThread**: Handles icon animations, particularly for dice rolling
- **GameUtil**: Utility functions for game resources and operations

#### Game Data Management
- **GameData**: Stores game resources, images and game state
- **StartGame**: Entry point for game initialization

## üöÄ Core Game Functionality

### Player Movement
```java
// Example code for player movement
public void move(int steps) {
    // Calculate new position
    int newPosition = currentPosition + steps;
    
    // Handle board wrapping
    if (newPosition >= boardSize) {
        newPosition = newPosition % boardSize;
    }
    
    // Update player position
    currentPosition = newPosition;
    
    // Draw player at new position
    drawMyself();
}
```

### Dice Rolling
```java
// Example dice rolling code
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {
    // Start the dice animation thread
    iconThread1.run();
    iconThread2.run();
    
    // Get random dice values
    dice1 = 1 + (int)(Math.random() * 6);
    dice2 = 1 + (int)(Math.random() * 6);
    
    // Calculate total and move player
    int total = dice1 + dice2;
    playResult(total);
}
```

### Event Handling
```java
// Example event handling code
public void events(Player p) {
    switch(eventType) {
        case START:
            start(p);
            break;
        case FATE:
            fate(p);
            break;
        case EXCHANGE:
            exchange(p);
            break;
        case TASK:
            task(p);
            break;
    }
}
```
